Gathering Olympic data was hard

1. No one has data on all medal winners. It doesn't exist. The closest thing is olympedia (thank god for that), but there are also a ton of useless entries like olympia 304 bce. BCE?? Before Jesus Christ was crucified?? It's also missing a few entries like salt lake city

2. Still, I compiled all of the results and was determined to just hand add the salt lake city results afterwards. What I found is that there are great deal of events that are not in todays olympics. For example, in the 1912 summer olympics, Alphonse Laverrière & Eugène-Édouard Monod were awarded a gold medal in architecture, for their "Building Plan of a Modern Stadium". That same olympics, Georges Hohrod & Martin Eschbach were given a gold in literature for their "Ode to Sport". 

I decided to not include these because the modern day olympics is primarily focused on physical ability and technique, and adding these would make it more likely to have a gold medal, although by a slim margin. 

Some issues while web-scraping: some entries featured a number, which is associated with the person participating. What we want is the name, to find out how many people even have a medal. Using name based recognition does open us up to potential issues, like people getting medals, changing their name and then getting another medal. Or people having the same name so there is one person with 2, instead of 2 individual people with one. However, I hope that these are neglible and don't have too much of an effect on the results.
